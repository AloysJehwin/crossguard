# Wallet-Specific Features Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **User-Specific Policy Dashboard**
- Policies are now wallet-specific
- When you switch wallets in MetaMask, the PolicyDashboard automatically updates
- Shows only policies owned by the connected wallet
- Displays wallet address in the UI
- Real-time updates when wallet changes

### 2. **Monitor Page Enhancements**
- Shows ALL policies from the blockchain
- Highlights your own policies with a "YOURS" badge
- Blue background for your policies
- Filter option to show only your policies
- Automatic updates when wallet changes

### 3. **Automatic Policy Reload**
- After purchasing insurance, PolicyDashboard auto-refreshes
- 2-second delay to ensure blockchain has updated
- No manual refresh needed

### 4. **Wallet Change Listeners**
All components now listen for:
- **Account changes** - Updates when you switch wallets
- **Chain changes** - Reloads page when you switch networks
- **Policy purchases** - Auto-refreshes after new purchase

## How It Works

### Wallet Connection Flow:
1. User connects wallet → Components detect account
2. Components load user-specific policies
3. UI shows personalized data

### Wallet Switch Flow:
1. User switches wallet in MetaMask
2. Event listener detects change
3. Components clear old data
4. New wallet's policies load automatically
5. UI updates instantly

### Purchase Flow:
1. User purchases insurance
2. Transaction completes
3. Event fires to PolicyDashboard
4. Dashboard waits 2 seconds (for blockchain)
5. Reloads policies automatically
6. New policy appears in list

## Key Components

### PolicyDashboard (`/insurance` page)
- Shows ONLY the connected wallet's policies
- Real-time wallet switching support
- Auto-refresh after purchase
- Statistics (total coverage, active policies, etc.)

### Monitor Page (`/monitor`)
- Shows ALL policies on the network
- Highlights user's own policies
- Optional filter for user's policies only
- Pool statistics for everyone

## Testing Different Wallets

1. **Connect Wallet A** → See Wallet A's policies
2. **Switch to Wallet B** in MetaMask → Automatically see Wallet B's policies
3. **Purchase with Wallet B** → Policy appears only for Wallet B
4. **Switch back to Wallet A** → See only Wallet A's policies again

## Security Features

- No cross-wallet data leakage
- Each wallet sees only its own policies
- Proper address validation
- Lower-case comparison for addresses
- Event cleanup on component unmount
